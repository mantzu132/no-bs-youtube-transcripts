## What is this?

A chrome extension that helps copy full or partial youtube transcripts smoothly. It was created as I didn't 
quite find anything that would have all of the features that I needed. 

## Features
* Copy the full transcript with a button click.
* Copy the chapters which you are currently watching transcript.
* Copy transcripts from a specific time range that you can insert yourself.
  * There is a 'Copy Current Time' button that will automatically copy the timestamp of your current position in the video.
  * You don't have to manually enter the time range yourself; if you expand the transcript and click on a specific transcript segment while the start time or end time input is focused, that segment's time will be automatically inserted into the input, ensuring that the video does not skip to that time.
      * This also works if you search the transcript.
* There is an 'Open AI site' button that when clicked will open the site that you set in the settings, allowing for easy
pasting of your transcript.
* If there is no transcript available, the container will not be displayed.
* Things you can do in settings:
  * Set the AI site
  * Set a custom wrapper for each copy option (full transcript, chapters transcript or time range transcript)
* Light / Dark mode.
