## What is this?

A Chrome extension that helps copy full or partial YouTube transcripts smoothly. It was created as I didn't 
quite find anything that would have all the features that I needed. 

## Features
* Copy the full transcript with a button click.
* Copy the transcript for the chapter that you are currently watching.
* Copy transcripts from a specific time range that you can insert yourself.
  * You don't have to insert the time range yourself; simply click the input field and then click on the YouTube seek bar to automatically capture the desired timestamp. This action won't affect video playback.
* A toast notification appears in the top-right corner to confirm whether the copy action was successful or failed.
* Things you can do in settings:
  * Set a custom wrapper for each copy option (full transcript, chapters transcript or time range transcript)
* Light / Dark mode.
